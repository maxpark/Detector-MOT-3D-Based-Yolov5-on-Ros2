CMake Warning (dev) in /home/mzc/code/ROS/dev_ws/src/detect_mot/cmake-build-debug/connext_cmake_module/check_abi/CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project(ProjectName)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:54 (find_package):
  By not providing "Finddetect_mot.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "detect_mot", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "detect_mot" with
  any of the following names:

    detect_motConfig.cmake
    detect_mot-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "detect_mot" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "detect_mot_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "detect_mot" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
